Right now, in your current build, you do not yet have those androgen computations wired end-to-end — you mostly have the diet/training + body comp engine (daily logs → recompute → dashboard/report) working, plus the design/spec for androgen logging and the measured-vs-imputed import approach.

So at this stage, you’re basically at:

✅ “Locking data points uploading right” (the plan + data model + import/delta logic spec)
❌ Not yet fully computing Androgen Readiness + Cortisol Suppression in the app UI (unless Replit already added new tables/screens for it, which from your screenshots, they haven’t).

What you likely already have (based on what we validated)
	•	Daily log persistence (Postgres)
	•	Recompute pipeline for:
	•	rolling weight averages
	•	lean mass calculation
	•	lean gain ratio rolling
	•	deload handling
	•	diet adjustment suggestions

What’s next (minimal, correct order)

To avoid “getting ahead,” the safest sequence is:
	1.	Create androgen data storage (no fancy math yet)
	•	erection_summary_snapshots
	•	erection_sessions with:
	•	date
	•	nocturnal_count
	•	nocturnal_duration_seconds
	•	firmness_score (optional)
	•	is_imputed, etc.
	2.	Import pipeline works reliably
	•	upload snapshot → delta → measured session row
	•	optional imputation between measured anchors
	•	badges show measured vs imputed
	3.	Only then add computations
	•	7-day rolling averages for:
	•	nocturnal count
	•	duration
	•	firmness (if present)
	•	Androgen Readiness Score (first version can be simple)
	•	Cortisol Suppression Flag: (HRV ↓ + erections ↓)
	4.	Only after you have 14–30 days of data
	•	correlation panels
	•	training/diet “cause” suggestions

The key: what we should not do yet
	•	We should not try to infer “male cycles” or do complex seasonality detection until you’ve built enough measured nightly history.
	•	We should not let imputed values drive coaching decisions.

Quick “definition of done” for Phase 1 (so you don’t overbuild)

You’re ready to start collecting real signal when your app can:
	•	✅ Upload a snapshot file + choose session date
	•	✅ Produce a measured delta row for that date
	•	✅ Show it in a timeline as “Measured”
	•	✅ If there are gaps, optionally fill them as “Imputed”
	•	✅ Charts can toggle measured-only vs include-imputed
	•	✅ Rolling 7-day count/duration are displayed (even if the readiness score is not yet)

If you show me your current DB tables list or the Report screen sections you have, I can tell you exactly which of these components are already implemented vs still missing — without guessing.
