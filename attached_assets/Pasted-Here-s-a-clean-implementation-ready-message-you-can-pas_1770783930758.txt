Here’s a clean, implementation-ready message you can paste to Replit to add interpretability + simple rules (no overfitting), using the data you already store (7d vs 28d baselines + confidence grade).

Replit request: Add “Signal Breakdown” + “Rule Card” under Training Readiness

1) Signal Breakdown (beneath Training Readiness)

Under the main readiness badge (e.g., 41 • Blue • Low Conf), add a compact breakdown list that shows direction + magnitude vs baseline:

Display exactly like:
	•	Sleep: -6% vs baseline
	•	HRV: +3% vs baseline
	•	RHR: +1 bpm vs baseline
	•	Proxy: -4% vs baseline
	•	Confidence: Low (3 measured / 7 days)

Rules:
	•	Sleep, HRV, Proxy show % delta relative to baseline:
	•	pct = ((roll7 - base28) / base28) * 100
	•	round to nearest integer (or 1 decimal)
	•	RHR shows absolute bpm delta:
	•	bpm = roll7_rhr - base28_rhr
	•	If any signal missing, show — (do not fabricate).
	•	Confidence line must include:
	•	grade (High/Med/Low/None)
	•	measured_count_last_7d (from confidence endpoint or DB)

Implementation note (backend):
Return in readiness endpoint (or cached readiness object):

{
  deltas: {
    sleep_pct: number|null,
    hrv_pct: number|null,
    rhr_bpm: number|null,
    proxy_pct: number|null
  },
  confidence: {
    grade: "High"|"Med"|"Low"|"None",
    measured_7d: number,
    imputed_7d: number,
    combined_7d: number
  }
}

2) Simple Rule Card (bottom of screen)

Add a small card titled “Today’s Training Rule” that maps readiness + confidence to one of 3 prescriptions:

Rule logic (exact):
	•	If readiness >= 65 AND confidence >= Med → High Neural Day
	•	Else if readiness >= 45 AND readiness < 65 → Moderate
	•	Else if readiness < 45 → Pump / Technique

Confidence ordering:
High > Med > Low > None

So confidence >= Med means grade is either High or Med.

Copy text inside the card (keep it simple):
	•	High Neural Day: heavy compounds / lower reps / longer rest
	•	Moderate: controlled compounds + machines / moderate reps
	•	Pump / Technique: isolation focus / easy volume / skill work

No extra logic, no personalization here. Keep it stable.

3) UI placement
	•	Training Readiness block at top
	•	Immediately below: Signal Breakdown (5 lines)
	•	At bottom of same screen: Today’s Training Rule card

4) Mindset copy (one line, optional)

Add a tiny subtitle under the readiness number:

“This doesn’t predict testosterone. It estimates recovery permissiveness (low stress + good restoration).”

Keep it subtle.

If you want, I can also give you the exact TS function for computing the deltas (7d vs 28d) and formatting rules for plus/minus signs so Replit can drop it straight into the readiness cache.
